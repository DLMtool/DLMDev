# Introduction

This is an example OM documentation file. It is based on a recent case study of Chile common hake from a

recent DLMtool workshop in Valparaiso, Chile, organized by Oceana Chile and funded by a joint project between 

Oceana, WWF, and EDF.



### Technical Tip

# Stock Parameters 

### Mortality and age:  maxage, R0, M, M2, Mexp, Msd, Mgrad

**maxage**: The maximum age of individuals that is simulated (there is no plus group ). Single value. Positive integer

The only reason not to make this very large for all stocks (e.g. maxage = 100) is that the more ages, the greater thenumber of calculations and the slower the MSE will run. Let's consider a rule of thumb: if the annual survival rate S to age a is calculated as $S_a = e^{-M_a}$, then the age corresponding with a 1% survival rate would be: maxage = $-ln(0.01)/M$. 

Based on this reasoning, the value for maxage was set based on the lower bound of the estimated range for M (see below). 

  <span style='color:blue'> (23)</span>



**R0**: The magnitude of unfished recruitment. Single value. Positive real number

This is the level of unfished recruitment. Unless management options are specified in absolutenumbers (e.g. tonnes) the MSE is scale-less (has no units) and this value simply doesn't matter  <span style='color:blue'> (1000)</span>



**M**: Natural mortality rate. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real number

The instantaneous annual natural mortality rate in the recent stock assessment was assumed to be 0.33 (Tascheri et al., 2017). In this example, we arbitrarily bracket the base case value by +/- 20% which leads to range in mean M of 0.26 ? 0.40. The bracketing is intended to represent the uncertainty in M that is typical in most fishery settings. 

Even extensive mark-recapture analyses rarely produce M estimates with a CV (standard deviation / mean) of less than 10%. The +/- 20% bracketing of 0.33 is roughly equivalent to the 5%-95% probability interval of a probability distribution for M with mean 0.33 and 10% CV.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.26, 0.4)</span>



**M2**: (Optional) Natural mortality rate at age. Vector of length maxage . Positive real number

Slot not used.

**Mexp**: Exponent of the Lorenzen function assuming an inverse relationship between M and weight. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Real numbers <= 0.

Natural mortality was assumed to be constant for all age/size-classes.  <span style='color:blue'> (0, 0)</span>



**Msd**: Inter-annual variability in natural mortality rate expressed as a coefficient of variation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

Given that M is very poorly quantified in most fishery settings, the annual variability in M is essentially unknown. All that can be concluded is that M should vary among years. To addressthis possibility in our simulations we specify inter-annual variability in M of up to 10%.  <span style='color:blue'> (0, 0.1)</span>



**Mgrad**: Mean temporal trend in natural mortality rate, expressed as a percentage change in M per year. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Real numbers

Persistent underlying trends in natural mortality have been hypothesized in response to, for example, shifts in trophic dynamics (e.g., predation) and regime shifts. The currentassessment document for common hake hypotheses an increasing trend for M due to jumbo squid (Tascheri et al., 2017). Therefore, for the purposes of this simulation, M was simulated as a time-varying parameter with a consistent increase in M between 0 and 0.25% per year.  <span style='color:blue'> (0, 0.25)</span>

```


### Recruitment: h, SRrel, Perr, AC, recgrad

**h**: Steepness of the stock recruit relationship. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Values from 1/5 to 1

The steepness of the stock-recruitment curve is the level of unfished recruitment at 20% of unfished spawning biomass. It follows it ranges between 0.2 (linear relationship of recruitment with SSB) and 1 (average recruitment is constant and unrelated to SSB) for the Beverton and Holt stock-recruitment model. For this analysis, we specify a range of 0.50 ? 0.70 for the steepness parameter. The current assessment model doesn't estimate this parameter and assumes a value h=0.67 (Tascheri et al., 2017).  <span style='color:blue'> (0.5, 0.7)</span>



**SRrel**: Type of stock-recruit relationship. Single value, switch (1) Beverton-Holt (2) Ricker. Integer

 This parameter specifies the model for the mean stock-recruitment relationship. DLMtool SRrel values can be 1 (Beverton Holt) or 2 (Ricker). We follow the assessment and assume a Ricker stock-recruitment relationship (2).  <span style='color:blue'> (2)</span>



**Perr**: Process error, the CV of lognormal recruitment deviations. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

 The magnitude of annual recruitment deviations was based on the stock assessment document (Tascheri et al., 2017).  <span style='color:blue'> (0.4, 0.6)</span>



**AC**: Autocorrelation in recruitment deviations rec(t)=AC*rec(t-1)+(1-AC)*sigma(t). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

 The current assessment doesn't report estimates for autocorrelation in recruitment, but the model results showed a strong autocorrelation in the residuals (see Fig 47 in Stock Assessment).   <span style='color:blue'> (0.6, 0.9)</span>



**recgrad**: Mean temporal trend in log-normal recruitment deviations, expressed as a percentage change per year. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Real numbers



  <span style='color:blue'> (0, 0)</span>

### Non-stationarity in stock productivity: Period, Amplitude

**Period**: (Optional) Period for cyclical recruitment pattern in years. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

Slot not used.

**Amplitude**: (Optional) Amplitude in deviation from long-term average recruitment during recruitment cycle (eg a range from 0 to 1 means recruitment decreases or increases by up to 100% each cycle). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

Slot not used.

### Growth: Linf, K, t0, LenCV, Ksd, Kgrad, Linfsd, Linfgrad

**Linf**: Maximum length. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

Estimates of growth were taken from Aguayo and Ojeda (1987), and Tascheri et al. (2017).  <span style='color:blue'> (69.27, 78.1)</span>



**K**: von Bertalanffy growth parameter k. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

Estimates of growth were taken from Aguayo and Ojeda (1987), and Tascheri et al. (2017).  <span style='color:blue'> (0.14, 0.2)</span>



**t0**: von Bertalanffy theoretical age at length zero. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-positive real numbers

Estimates of growth were taken from Aguayo and Ojeda (1987), and Tascheri et al. (2017).  <span style='color:blue'> (-0.66, -0.23)</span>



**LenCV**: Coefficient of variation of length-at-age (assumed constant for all age classes). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

There is little information available on the variability of length-at-age for this species. We based the parameter range for this slot on values typically observed in teleosts.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.1, 0.12)</span>



**Ksd**: Inter-annual variability in growth parameter k. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

This is some information available for this parameter across years (Cerna et al., 2013), but it is difficult to determine a long-term trend. We assume a small amount of inter-annual variability in this parameter.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.05, 0.1)</span>



**Kgrad**: Mean temporal trend in growth parameter k, expressed as a percentage change in k per year. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Real numbers

We assume virtually no long-term trend in this parameter.  <span style='color:blue'> (-0.01, 0.01)</span>



**Linfsd**: Inter-annual variability in maximum length. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

This is some information available for this parameter across years (Cerna et al., 2013), but it is difficult to determine a long-term trend. We assume a small amount of inter-annual variability in this parameter.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.02, 0.05)</span>



**Linfgrad**: Mean temporal trend in maximum length, expressed as a percentage change in Linf per year. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Real numbers

We assume virtually no long-term trend in this parameter.  <span style='color:blue'> (-0.01, 0.01)</span>



```{r plot.Linf, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=1.5}
plotSlot(OM, Pars, slot='Linf')
```


### Maturity: L50, L50_95

**L50**: Length at 50 percent maturity. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

The range for this parameter was based on the results of Alarcon and Arancibia (1993).

There appears to be a shift in maturity-at-length over time (Tascheri et al., 2017). Currently, maturity-at-length is assumed to be time-invariant in DLMtool. If this is an important aspect to consider, we can modify the DLMtool model to account for time-varying maturity-at-length.  <span style='color:blue'> (36, 37.4)</span>



**L50_95**: Length increment from 50 percent to 95 percent maturity. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

 Based on the same studies as used above.  <span style='color:blue'> (5, 10)</span>



```{r plot.L50, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=1}
plotSlot(OM, Pars, slot='L50')
```


### Stock depletion: D

**D**: Current level of stock depletion SSB(current)/SSB(unfished). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Fraction

We set the bounds for this parameter based on the results of the recent stock assessment, which estimated depletion as 0.21 (Tascheri et al., 2017). The wider bounds were used to reflect the uncertainty estimate of stock depletion in the stock assessment.

  <span style='color:blue'> (0.15, 0.25)</span>



```{r plot.D, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=0.5}
plotSlot(OM, Pars, slot='D')
```


### Length-weight conversion parameters: a, b

**a**: Length-weight parameter alpha. Single value. Positive real number

 Based on the empirical length-weight relationship (Cerna & Oyarzun 1998).  <span style='color:blue'> (0)</span>



**b**: Length-weight parameter beta. Single value. Positive real number

 Based on the empirical length-weight relationship (Cerna & Oyarzun 1998).  <span style='color:blue'> (2.77)</span>



### Spatial distribution and movement: Size_area_1, Frac_area_1, Prob_staying

**Size_area_1**: The size of area 1 relative to area 2. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

No justification provided. <span style='color:blue'> (0.5, 0.5)</span>



**Frac_area_1**: The fraction of the unfished biomass in stock 1. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

We simulate a fully fixed stock and assume half the stock is in area 1 and half in area 2.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.5, 0.5)</span>



**Prob_staying**: The probability of inviduals in area 1 remaining in area 1 over the course of one year. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive fraction.

We simulate a well mixed stock and assume half individuals remain in the same area among years.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.5, 0.5)</span>



### Discard Mortality: Fdisc 

**Fdisc**: Fraction of discarded fish that die. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

There was little information available on the discard mortality for this species. The range for this parameter was set based on expert knowledge of the fishery and the stock.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.1, 0.3)</span>



# Fleet Parameters 

### Historical years of fishing, spatial targeting: nyears, Spat_targ

**nyears**: The number of years for the historical spool-up simulation. Single value. Positive integer

The stock assessment and fishery data indicates that the fishery has been operatingsince 1940, with the latest assessment (from which the parameters in this OM are based) in 2016.  <span style='color:blue'> (77)</span>



**Spat_targ**: Distribution of fishing in relation to spatial biomass: fishing distribution is proportional to B^Spat_targ. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Real numbers

This feature is currently being developed for DLMtool. We're going to stick to the default level of 1 (targeting in proportion to density) in preparation for its implementation.  <span style='color:blue'> (1, 1)</span>



### Trend in historical fishing effort (exploitation rate), interannual variability in fishing effort: EffYears, EffLower, EffUpper, Esd

**EffYears**: Years representing join-points (vertices) of time-varying effort. Vector. Non-negative real numbers

 This is the vertex (year) for a major change in effort (fishing mortality rate). In this casewe use the estimates from the SSRA for each historical year and therefore we make this 1, 2, 3, ? 77 (nyears).  



**EffLower**: Lower bound on relative effort corresponding to EffYears. Vector. Non-negative real numbers

We use the SSRA analysis to estimate the lower bound for the historical fishing effort  



**EffUpper**: Upper bound on relative effort corresponding to EffYears. Vector. Non-negative real numbers

As above.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(round(Effvals,2), format='markdown', caption='')
```

**Esd**: Additional inter-annual variability in fishing mortality rate. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

This is really variability in addition to the underlying trend described by EffLower and EffUpper. It is used only to generate historical fishing patterns. In data-limited cases a very simple (general, mean) historical trajectory in effort may be established and it may be desirable to add additional inter-annual variability to reflect changes in fishing intensity among years. In this case we're going to be using stock assessment outputs directly that have detailed annual variability information and have no need to superimpose greater variability.   <span style='color:blue'> (0, 0)</span>



```{r plot.EffUpper, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=0.5}
plotSlot(OM, Pars, slot='EffUpper')
```


### Annual increase in catchability, interannual variability in catchability: qinc, qcv

**qinc**: Average percentage change in fishing efficiency (applicable only to forward projection and input controls). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

In this example, we allow for an increasing future trends in fishing efficiency by setting up to a 2% annual increase in fishing efficiency.  <span style='color:blue'> (0, 2)</span>



**qcv**: Inter-annual variability in fishing efficiency (applicable only to forward projection and input controls). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

To evaluate variability in fishing efficiency among years it is necessary to compare observed catch rates with an index of abundance (or assessed biomass). For this parameter we assume that the fleet with varies in its efficiency between years.

  <span style='color:blue'> (0.1, 0.3)</span>



```{r plot.qcv, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=1}
plotSlot(OM, Pars, slot='qcv')
```


### Fishery gear length selectivity: L5, LFS, Vmaxlen, isRel

**L5**: Shortest length corresponding to 5 percent vulnerability. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

We assume that the length corresponding to 5% vulnerability to the fishing gear is in the range of 15 ? 20 cm. Queirolo et al. (2012) demonstrate that mesh size is an import factor in determining the size at first capture.  <span style='color:blue'> (15, 20)</span>



**LFS**: Shortest length that is fully vulnerable to fishing. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

We assume that the length of full selectivity is in the range of 35 ? 40 cm (Queirolo et al., 2012).  <span style='color:blue'> (35, 40)</span>



**Vmaxlen**: The vulnerability of the longest/oldest fish. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Fraction

We assume that there is no dome-shaped selectivity because empirical studies havemodeled the selectivity as asymptotic (Galvez & Hernan, 2005; Queirolo et al., 2008, 2012) for this hake fishery. Thus, all lengths above LFS are fully vulnerable to the fishery.   <span style='color:blue'> (1, 1)</span>



**isRel**: Selectivity parameters in units of size-of-maturity (or absolute eg cm). Single value. Boolean.

Selectivity parameters are in absolute numbers (not relative to size of maturity).

  <span style='color:blue'> (FALSE)</span>



```{r plot.Vmaxlen, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=1}
plotSlot(OM, Pars, slot='Vmaxlen')
```


### Fishery length retention: LR5, LFR, Rmaxlen, DR

**LR5**: Shortest length corresponding ot 5 percent retention. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

Based on empirical selectivity studies (Queirolo et al. 2012) and the mean length-at-agecurve described by the von Bertalanffy growth model, we set the range for the length at  5% retention to 20 ? 25 cm. Note that the legal mesh size is 100 mm and according to Queirolo et al. (2012), the 50% retention length is 30.8 cm of total length.  <span style='color:blue'> (20, 25)</span>



**LFR**: Shortest length that is fully retained. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

Based on Queirolo et al. (2012) and the mean length-at-age curve described by the vonBertalanffy growth model, we set the range for the length at full retention to 40 ? 50 cm.  <span style='color:blue'> (40, 50)</span>



**Rmaxlen**: The retention of the longest (oldest) fish. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

 We understand that fishers value large size individuals and assume that the retentioncurve is asymptotic by setting this parameter to 1.  <span style='color:blue'> (1, 1)</span>



**DR**: Discard rate - the fraction of caught fish that are discarded. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Fraction

The general discard rate. What fraction of fish across all size and age classes are discarded? There is general discarding across all size-classes in some fisheries. We assume that this is not the case in the hake fishery.



  <span style='color:blue'> (0, 0)</span>



```{r plot.DR, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=0.75}

```


### Time-varying selectivity: SelYears, AbsSelYears, L5Lower, L5Upper, LFSLower, LFSUpper, VmaxLower, VmaxUpper

**SelYears**: (Optional) Years representing join-points (vertices) at which historical selectivity pattern changes. Vector. Positive real numbers

Slot not used.

**AbsSelYears**: (Optional) Calendar years corresponding with SelYears (eg 1951, rather than 1), used for plotting only. Vector (of same length as SelYears). Positive real numbers

Slot not used.

**VmaxUpper**: (Optional) Upper bound of Vmaxlen (use ChooseSelect function to set these). Vector. Fraction

Slot not used.

### Current Year: CurrentYr

**CurrentYr**: The current calendar year (final year) of the historical simulations (eg 2011). Single value. Positive integer.

The current year (last historical year) can be used to make the plots moreinformative. As the stock assessment which was used to parameterize the OM uses data up to 2016, we set this parameter to 2016.



  <span style='color:blue'> (2016)</span>



# Obs Parameters 

### Catch statistics: Cobs, Cbiascv, CAA_nsamp, CAA_ESS, CAL_nsamp, CAL_ESS, CALcv

**Cobs**: Log-normal catch observation error expressed as a coefficient of variation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

Here was assume that the annual catches a reported somewhat imprecisely.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.1, 0.3)</span>



**Cbiascv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation controlling the sampling of bias in catch observations for each simulation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

We assume that it is likely that the reported catches are sometimes biased (that is,higher or lower than the real catches) and set the CV for this parameter to 0.1. Thiscorresponds to the assumption that 95% of reported catches are between 80% and 120% of the real catches.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.1)</span>



**CAA_nsamp**: Number of catch-at-age observation per time step. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

The number of samples taken per year for age and length compositions. We assume these are around 5,000 to 10,000 and 250 to 500 fish per year for the length and age compositions based on Lillo et al., (2017).  <span style='color:blue'> (250, 500)</span>



**CAA_ESS**: Effective sample size (independent age draws) of the multinomial catch-at-age observation error model. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive integers

See above.  <span style='color:blue'> (50, 150)</span>



**CAL_nsamp**: Number of catch-at-length observation per time step. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive integers

Here we assume that there is some non-independence in the observationsof age and length (ie individuals are caught in age/size monospecific aggregations. The effective sample size is hence assumed to be lower than the sample size at around 100 independent observations, 50 - 150.  <span style='color:blue'> (250, 500)</span>



**CAL_ESS**: Effective sample size (independent length draws) of the multinomial catch-at-length observation error model. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive integers

See above.  <span style='color:blue'> (50, 150)</span>



**CALcv**: Log-normal, CV of length-at-age. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

Assumed that catch-at-length has no obseration error.   <span style='color:blue'> (0, 0)</span>



### Index imprecision, bias and hyperstability: Iobs, Icv, Btcv, Btbias, beta

**Iobs**: Observation error in the relative abundance indices expressed as a coefficient of variation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

Chile hake has a survey that can act as both an index of relative abundance (I) and anindex of absolute abundance (Bt) (Lillo et al., 2017). Here we set the allow for the fishery independent survey to have some observation error.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.1, 0.3)</span>



**Icv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation controlling error in observations of relative abundance index. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

This parameter is not used in this version of DLMtool.  <span style='color:blue'> (0)</span>



**Btcv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation controlling error in observations of current stock biomass among years. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

See Iobs  <span style='color:blue'> (0.1, 0.3)</span>



**Btbias**: Uniform-log bounds for sampling persistent bias in current stock biomass. Uniform-log distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

The bias in the absolute abundance index is assumed to be low and 95% of simulateddata sets are assumed to be within 20% of the true value.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.8, 1.2)</span>



**beta**: A parameter controlling hyperstability/hyperdepletion where values below 1 lead to hyperstability (an index that decreases slower than true abundance) and values above 1 lead to hyperdepletion (an index that decreases more rapidly than true abundance). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

Since the survey is carried out according to a systematic homogenous design (Lillo et al.,2017) we assume that it varies in proportion to real abundance changes (beta values less than 1 are hyperstable ? index declining slower than real abundance, beta greater than 1 are hyperdeplete ? index declining faster than real abundance).  <span style='color:blue'> (1, 1)</span>



### Bias in maturity, natural mortality rate and growth parameters: LenMcv, Mcv, Kcv, t0cv, Linfcv

**LenMcv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in length at 50 percent maturity. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

Some MPs use length at maturity as a reference point for setting size limits. Here we assume we could get this consistently wrong by around +/- 10%.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.05)</span>



**Mcv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in observed natural mortality rate. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

We assume of a CV of 0.2 to reflect some uncertainty in this parameter.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.2)</span>



**Kcv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in observed growth parameter K. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

 We assume of a CV of 0.1 to reflect some uncertainty in this parameter.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.1)</span>



**t0cv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in observed t0. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

We choose not to simulate bias in this growth parameter and assume in all cases it is correct.  <span style='color:blue'> (0)</span>



**Linfcv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in observed maximum length. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

We assume of a CV of 0.1 to reflect some uncertainty in this parameter.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.1)</span>



### Bias in length at first capture, length at full selection: LFCcv, LFScv

**LFCcv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in observed length at first capture. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

 Given the reasonably extensive length sampling data, it is straightforward to estimate LFC for hake from the length frequency data and this is likely to be reasonably well known without substantial bias.   <span style='color:blue'> (0.05)</span>



**LFScv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in length-at-full selection. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

Estimating LFS is more difficult than estimating LFC because the length frequency data are the product of both increasing vulnerability and the declining age-structure of the population given M and F.   <span style='color:blue'> (0.05)</span>



### Bias in fishery reference points, unfished biomass, FMSY, FMSY/M ratio, biomass at MSY relative to unfished: FMSYcv, FMSY_Mcv, BMSY_B0cv

**FMSYcv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in FMSY. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

Note that FMSY is not the same thing as the maximum sustainable rate of fishing, Fmax. Assuming surplus production dynamics, FMSY is half of Fmax. Above FMSY and below Fmax are sustainable fishing rates that lead to lower biomass than BMSY and do not provide as much yield (on average, at equilibrium) as fishing at FMSY with biomass at BMSY It has been proposed by Gulland (1978) and Walters and Martell (2003) that FMSY may be summarized as a fraction of natural mortality rate M. Gulland suggested FMSY = M, Walters and Martell though FMSY=0.5 x M. 

It is not clear how biased such an estimate could be but assuming that this uncertainty reflects the possible range of prescribed values (and brackets the true ratio) and this occurs on top of bias in estimates of natural mortality, the range of possible biases must be higher than that assigned to M (0.33). This is set at 0.4 to reflect the potential for inaccurate estimates of FMSY.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.4)</span>



**FMSY_Mcv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in FMSY/M. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

A number of MPs aim to fish at a fixed rate proportional to the estimate of M (e.g. Fratio). Other MPs use this ratio to undertake stock reduction analysis (e.g. DB-SRA). Given the references above we set this to be moderately inaccurate given a CV of 0.15.

  <span style='color:blue'> (0.15)</span>



**BMSY_B0cv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in BMSY relative to unfished. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

 We have assigned a relatively precise CV for potential accuracy at 0.05.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.05)</span>



### Management targets in terms of the index (i.e., model free), the total annual catches and absolute biomass levels: Irefcv, Crefcv, Brefcv

**Irefcv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in relative abundance index at BMSY. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

Here we assume that the index and MSY (a desirable catch level) can be known more accurately than a desirable absolute biomass level (e.g. BMSY) and assign these a rangedetermined by a CV of 0.2.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.2)</span>



**Crefcv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in MSY. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

As Irefcv.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.2)</span>



**Brefcv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in BMSY. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

Arbitrarily we make this twice as potentially biased as Iref and Cref.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.4)</span>



### Depletion bias and imprecision: Dbiascv, Dcv

**Dbiascv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in stock depletion. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

These are probably the most controversial observation model quantities, after all the most valuable output of a data-rich assessment is arguably the level of stock depletion  (typically measured as spawning stock biomass today relative to unfished). If we could know this, for stocks with stationary productivity (where depletion is a very good predictor of stock productivity) we could achieve very good management performance with simple harvest control rules (in essence this is how the outputs of data-rich stock assessments are used). 

Having said this, in most cases assessments are evaluated based on their fit to a fishery dependent (e.g. catch per unit effort) or fishery independent (e.g. trawl survey, acoustic survey) relative abundance index. It follows that often the depletion estimate arising from a stock assessment follows the raw data fairly well. Consequently, even anecdotal historical catch rate data may be used in a data-limited context to frame estimates of stock depletion. Similarly, if unfished densities of a species can be quantified (e.g. urchins per sq km of habitat), total estimates of habitat and current density surveys could be used to extrapolate a range of stock depletion.



Alternatively, length frequency data can provide an imprecise estimate of stock  epletion when accompanied with estimates of natural mortality rate and growth (and some  assumption about the pattern of recent fishing rates).

Here we assign an arbitrary value of 0.25 which is relatively imprecise and means that assume depletion could up to double or half of the true simulated value.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.25)</span>



**Dcv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation controlling error in observations of stock depletion among years. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

In a data-limited situation it is unlikely that radically new data would become available regarding depletion meaning that while estimates may be biased, they are likely to be relatively precise. We assign a level of imprecision consistent with observations of catch rate data among years at between 0.05- 0.1.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.05, 0.1)</span>



### Recruitment compensation and trend: hcv, Reccv

**hcv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in steepness. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

The stock assessment provides very little support for particular values of recruitmentcompensation. In DLMtool this is parameterized as steepness (the fraction of unfishedrecruitment at 20% of unfished spawning biomass, a value ranging from 0.2-1). Here we assume that any MP could get this wrong by a large margin.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.2)</span>



**Reccv**: Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling persistent bias in recent recruitment strength. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers

We do not have a good idea how good the recruitment index for hake is. Here we assume it could be moderately imprecise with a CV between 0.1 and 0.2.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.1, 0.2)</span>



### Currently unused observation processes

*bias in unfished biomass, intrinsic rate of increase, annual increase in fishing efficiency and age at 50% vulnerability, bias and imprecision in current fishing rate, bias in maximum age: B0cv, rcv, Fcurbiascv, Fcurcv, maxagecv*

# Imp Parameters 

### Output Control Implementation Error: TACFrac, TACSD

**TACFrac**: Mean fraction of TAC taken. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real number.

 Here we assume that the actual catches can be up to 20% higher than the recommended TAC.   <span style='color:blue'> (0.05, 0.1)</span>



**TACSD**: Log-normal coefficient of variation in the fraction of Total Allowable Catch (TAC) taken. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.

 We assume that the bias in the actual catch is relatively consistent between years and set the range for this parameter to a low value.  <span style='color:blue'> (1, 1.2)</span>



### Effort Control Implementation Error: EFrac, ESD

**EFrac**: Mean fraction of TAE taken. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real number.

We have little information to inform this parameter, and set the implementation error in effort equal to the TAC implementation error.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.05, 0.1)</span>



**ESD**: Log-normal coefficient of variation in the fraction of Total Allowable Effort (TAE) taken. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.

We assume that the bias in the effort is relatively consistent between years and set the range for this parameter to a low value.  <span style='color:blue'> (1, 1.2)</span>



### Size Limit Control Implementation Error: SizeLimFrac, SizeLimSD

**SizeLimFrac**: The real minimum size that is retained expressed as a fraction of the size. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real number.

We assume that, on average, a size limit would be well-implemented.  <span style='color:blue'> (0.05, 0.1)</span>



**SizeLimSD**: Log-normal coefficient of variation controlling mismatch between a minimum size limit and the real minimum size retained. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.

 We assume that the implementation of the size limit is relatively consistent between years.
