- alternative growth patterns (other than vB) can be used by passing Len_age array (nsim, maxage, nyears+proyears) in with cpars
    vB parameters are estimated from the length-at-age array for the data object 
- same with Wt_age (weight-at-age) and estimate a and b from L - W relationship from data 

To Do: test providing these data to cpars 


Add length-at-age CV to stock object?
