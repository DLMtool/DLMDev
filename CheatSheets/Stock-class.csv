"Name","The name of the Stock object"
"maxage","The maximum age of individuals that is simulated (there is no 'plus group': individuals die off beyone the maximum age so there isn't a huge cost to simulating more older age classes)"
"R0","The magnitude of unfished recruitment. This is normally fixed to some arbitrary value since it simply scales the simulated numbers)"
"M","Natural mortality rate (uniform distribution)"
"Msd","Inter-annual variability in natural mortality rate expressed as a coefficient of variation (uniform distribution)"
"Mgrad","Mean temporal trend in natural mortality rate, expressed as a percentage change in M per year (uniform distribution)"
"h","Steepness of the stock recruit relationship (uniform distribution)"
"SRrel","Type of stock-recruit relationship (1)Beverton-Holt (2) Ricker"

"Kgrad","Mean temporal trend in growth parameter k, expressed as a percentage change in k per year (uniform distribution)"
"Linfsd","Inter-annual variability in maximum length - uniform distribution"
"Linfgrad","Mean temporal trend in maximum length, expressed as a percentage change in Linf per year (uniform distribution)"
"recgrad","Mean temporal trend in log-normal recruitment deviations (uniform distribution)"
"AC","Autocorrelation in recruitment deviations rec(t)=AC*rec(t-1)+(1-AC)*sigma(t) (uniform distribution)"

"Period","Period for cylical recruitment pattern in years (uniform distribution). Leave empty to ignore"
"Amplitude","Amplitude in deviation from long-term average recruitment during recruitment cycle, both positive and negative (uniform distribution). E.g., a range from 0 to 0.5 means recruitment decreases or increases by up to 50% each cycle. Leave empty to ignore"
